# Sales-Management-System
I have done this project using C-language.

Here I am using structure data model to store the details of an element in the file.

Members of the Logging structure element are:

  char fullname
  
  char username
  
  char password

Members of the Product structure element are:

  int product_id
  
  char product_code
  
  char product_name
  
  char product_type
  
  char product_weight
  
  loat cost_per_item
  
  char total_stock

Members of the Customer structure element are:

  char customername
  
  char mobilenumber
  
  char Productname
  
  float priceperitem
  
  int totalitems
  
  float totalcost
  
  char status

The operations on the structure element are:

  Admin Signup
  
  Admin Login
  
  Add Product
  
  Product Reports
  
  Search Product
  
  Modify Product
  
  Delete Product
  
  Add Sells
  
  Sells Report
  
  Log Out
