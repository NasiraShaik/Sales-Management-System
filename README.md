# Sales-Management-System
I have done this project using C-language.
Here I am using structure data model to store the details of an element in the file.

Members of the Logging structure element are:
  char fullname
  char username
  char password

Members of the Product structure element are:

  int product_id
	char product_code
	char product_name
	char product_type
	char product_weight
	float cost_per_item
	char total_stock

Members of the Customer structure element are:
  char customername
  char mobilenumber
  char Productname
	float priceperitem
	int totalitems
	float totalcost
	char status

The operations on the structure element are:
  Admin Signup
  Admin Login
  Add Product
  Product Reports
  Search Product
  Modify Product
  Delete Product
  Add Sells
  Sells Report
  Log Out

This is how the initial screen will look like:
